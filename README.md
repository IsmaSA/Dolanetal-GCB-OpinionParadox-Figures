# Riverine barrier removals could proliferate biological invasions

**Abstract** 	 	

Multiple stressors comprising pollution, climate change, invasive species and fragmentation threaten global ecosystems and require holistic management actions to avoid ecological surprises. Freshwaters are disproportionately biodiverse and impacted by fragmentation and biological invasions, urging effective conservation and restoration through research and legislation. Artificial barriers, such as dams and weirs, are long-standing features of global landscapes, with a divergence of views on their benefits and disbenefits developing in recent years. Recognition of the negative impacts of barriers on the river continuum and native biota, particularly for migratory aquatic species, has led to a rapid rate of barrier removals in recent decades, especially in North America and Europe. However,  since the rise in riverine barrier construction centuries ago, global biological invasion rates have concurrently surged.  Artificial barriers can paradoxically slow the spread of non-native species through freshwaters, and barrier removal efforts thus risk proliferating biological invasions that disperse rapidly through better-connected habitats. Here, we highlight that despite well-intended plans for river restoration through barrier removals, the subsequent spread and colonisation of invasive species has been largely overlooked in recent years. This presents a ‘connectivity conundrum’: the removal of barriers intuitively addresses the issues of native species migrations and movement, but could perversely exacerbate biological invasions. Wide-scale data collection around the short- and long-term impacts on invasive species will help to underpin future restoration projects and maximise the potential beneficial outcomes of barrier removals for native species.
